## Our Journey

The story of **Nick DwtyAy** is one of resilience, creativity, and innovation, driven by founder Nic√°ssio Guimar√£es from Candeal, Bahia, Brazil (CEP 48710-000):

- **2006**: Born as a pseudonym on Orkut to protect Nic√°ssio‚Äôs identity, **Nick DwtyAy** marked the start of a digital journey.
- **2010‚Äì2012**: Transitioned to Facebook, maintaining anonymity while building an online presence.
- **2014‚Äì2017**: Launched a YouTube channel ([youtube.com/nickdwtyay](https://www.youtube.com/nickdwtyay)), achieving a milestone with a video garnering **100,000 views** in days, a landmark for Candeal. Published over 70 videos but faced platform strikes, leading to a pause.
- **2017**: Developed **Candeal Not√≠cia**, a popular local blog on Blogger, archived at web.archive.org, and learned **HTML** and **CSS**, skills still used today.
- **2018**: Concluded Candeal Not√≠cia, leaving a lasting community impact.
- **2018‚Äì2021**: Expanded into media, engaging with series and films on platforms like Filmow, and launched short miniseries on **Kwai** and **TikTok**. TikTok gained **3,500 followers** before a strike deleted high-quality content. Kwai thrived, hitting **1 million views** on a single video (2021‚Äì2022).
- **2021‚Äì2025**: Grew **Kwai** to **10,000 followers**, with **5,000‚Äì17,000 monthly views** and over **300 videos** on holidays and commemorative dates. Established a GitHub profile in 2021, with active contributions starting later.
- **2023**: Launched [nickdwtyay.com.br](https://nickdwtyay.com.br) using **GitHub** for hosting and **Cloudflare** for DNS, incorporating **HTML Canvas**, **SVG**, and advanced technologies.
- **2025**: Evolved the website to **PHP** with a database, integrated with **GitHub**, **Vercel**, and **Supabase**, currently in production. Advancing cybersecurity tools like the DNS cleanup script (version 2.2 in testing).

Today, **Nick DwtyAy Ltd.** is a beacon of innovation, scaling infrastructure and creating impactful media for a global audience.
