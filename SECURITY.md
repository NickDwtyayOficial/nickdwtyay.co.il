## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

The security policy is based on all the committees established in all districts in each country and their regions. Therefore, all the rules established in all global judicial boards must be used and accepted.
